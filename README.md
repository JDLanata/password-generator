# password-generator
## Description
- In this day and age it seems that we need passwords for everything. This website was designed to generate a random password based on a user set peramiters. 
- The frist step was to create a set of prompts and alerts that were designed to gather the information needed form the user. 
- The next step was to ask the user how long they wanted to password to be. At the same time setting the limit no less than 8 characters and no more than 12.
- Third was to ask if they wanted Uppercase, Lowercase, numbers, or special characters.
- The last step was taking infromation and generating and presenting the finialized password.
